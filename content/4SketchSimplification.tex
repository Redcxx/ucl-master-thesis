\chapter{Sketch Simplification}

Sketch Simplification refers to automatically converts rough sketches into simplified clean drawings. It is one of the most fundamental task because it is the first step into the whole of the pipeline. An accurate and fast method is required to provide solid foundation for subsequent processing. However, as we will see, it is a relatively under-explored area and we yet to see a fast and high quality procedure for this tasks. As such, it is expected to be the most research intensive area for future development. Nevertheless, the task itself is relative straight forward and similar problems have developed mature solutions, therefore it is not expected to be difficult. I will also propose a number of possible directions for future experiments.

\section{Approaches \& Methods}
Traditionally, rough sketches are iteratively refined by the artist himself/herself. This requires manually tracing the rough sketch repeatedly to produce a clean and satisfying drawing. This process is tedious, time-consuming and involve a large overhead.
