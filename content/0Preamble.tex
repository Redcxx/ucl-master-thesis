\begin{abstract} % 300 word limit
This preceding project researches and implements state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in machine learning image-to-image translation for enhancing 2D animation development workflow. It tries to address the waterfall development problem by allowing artists to preview outcomes given initial creative inputs. Combining the task of frame interpolation, image colourization, sketch simplification, and super-resolution, this work indicates possible future directions and limitations for future iterations and further studies.

% \begin{impactstatement}
% 	In the 2D animation industry, the process of creating 2D animation consists of a number of steps, some of which could be labour-intensive and often constitute up to 50\% of the budget. The industry is falling behind when it comes to creative tools in 2D animation. Currently, the lead artist gives front-loaded creative inputs followed by intensive labour tasks over which he has little control. We want the artist to have an accurate preview of what might be in the final product. Contrasting to traditional approaches, our proposed workflow is designed around the capabilities of the artists, allowing them to take a shot from start to finish with creative control along the way. The final tool-set will allow one animator to complete work that typically requires five animators to do.

I very much appreciate Dr Tobias Ritschel, Professor of Computer Graphics at University College London for supervising this project. This work is also in collaboration with NoGhost, a real-time creative animation studio based in London. Especially, I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to Jack Straw and Luke Gibbard from NoGhost for their continued support throughout the project.
