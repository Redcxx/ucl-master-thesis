To summarise, modern 2D animation consists of a sequence of complex and time-consuming tasks, automating these procedures is a challenging task. This master project investigates the possibility of automating such workflow to generate creative previews. We split the proposed automation system into 4 individual image-to-image translation tasks, researched independently and conducted a number of experiments that reflected positive. Collectively, we found that recent machine learning models are capable of generating high-quality samples on each task. While there can be technical difficulties while integrating the parts, We can conclude that the proposed system is a potentially fesible solution to give artists an accurate preview with near real-time performance.
